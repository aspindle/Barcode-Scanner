# Barcode-Scanner
This is all the code for a simple barcode scanner. 
You will need to install nedb, quagga, and p5 even though I don't use the last one.
A database.db file will need to be created also.

The app allows you to scan a barcode and store it to the database.
You can also view a page that lists out items in the database.
